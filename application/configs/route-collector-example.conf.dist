#
# Example Configuration for Route Collector
#
# Typically you'd have one config per server and protocol and you'd name
# it such as rc1-vlan10-ipv4.conf
#
# This is a Smarty configuration file defining template variables.
# See: http://www.smarty.net/docs/en/language.config.variables.tpl
#
# See: https://github.com/inex/IXP-Manager/wiki/Route-Collector
#

# The variables are named 'rsconf' as these configuartion files were 
# originally used for route servers. We've kept the same naming 
# convention so config snippets can be shared between route servers
# and collectors.

# The hostname, password and (crypted) enable password variables can 
#Â be used by the Quagga configurations
#rsconfHostname       = "rs1-vlan2-ipv4"
#rsconfPassword       = "supersecret"
#rsconfEnablePassword = "8 6EDH8nBl3ijUA"

# The log file directory is used by the example Quagga and Bird configs
rsconfLogfile        = "/var/log/bird/bgpd-rc1-quar-vlan10-ipv4.log"

# These would typically be used by most / all configs
rsconfASN            = "65500"
rsconfRouterID       = "192.0.2.8"
rsconfListenAddr     = "192.0.2.8"
