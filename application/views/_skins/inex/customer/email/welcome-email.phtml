Dear New INEX Member,

Firstly, welcome to {$options.identity.orgname}! This is your {$options.identity.name} welcome e-mail.

Please take some time to read this email -- it contains important information concerning your {$options.identity.orgname} membership.

Several sections of this email require your input; these are all clearly marked by the heading "Your Input".  We would appreciate if you could provide us with all the details requested as this will allow us to provide you and other {$options.identity.orgname} members with a better quality of service.


Connection Details
==================

You have opted to connect to {$options.identity.orgname} using {$customer->getVirtualInterfaces()|@count} Ethernet ports.

Unless you have been advised otherwise, you have been assigned an untagged port on the primary peering LAN(s).

We have assigned the following IP addresses and switch-ports for your exclusive use:

{foreach $customer->getVirtualInterfaces() as $connection}
============================================
Connection {counter name=numconnections}
============================================

LAG Port:        {if $connection->getPhysicalinterfaces()|@count > 1}Yes, comprising of:{else}No{/if}

{foreach $connection->getPhysicalinterfaces() as $pi}
Switch Port:     {$pi->getSwitchPort()->getSwitcher()->getName()}.inex.ie, {$pi->getSwitchPort()->getName()}
Speed:           {$pi->getSpeed()}Mbps
Duplex:          {$pi->getDuplex()}
Location:        {$pi->getSwitchPort()->getSwitcher()->getCabinet()->getLocation()->getName()}
Colo Cabinet ID: {$pi->getSwitchPort()->getSwitcher()->getCabinet()->getName()}

{/foreach}

{foreach $connection->getVlanInterfaces() as $vi}
{$vlanid = $vi->getVlan()->getId()}
{$vi->getVlan()->getName()}
---------------------------------------------

{if $vi->getIpv6enabled()}
IPv6 Address:  {$vi->getIPv6Address()->getAddress()}/{$netinfo.$vlanid.6.masklen}
IPv6 Hostname: {$vi->getIpv6hostname()}
{else}
IPv6:          Please contact us at {$options.identity.email} to enable IPv6
{/if}

{if $vi->getIpv4enabled()}
IPv4 Address:  {$vi->getIPv4Address()->getAddress()}/{$netinfo.$vlanid.4.masklen}
IPv4 Hostname: {$vi->getIpv4hostname()}
{else}
IPv4:          Please contact us at {$options.identity.email} to enable IPv4
{/if}

{/foreach}

{/foreach}

Your Input
----------

As a matter of policy, {$options.identity.orgname} hard-wires all switch ports to a specific speed and duplex setting.  Should you require a different duplex setting to the one specified above, or should you require your reverse DNS hostnames changed for either IPv4 or IPv6, please contact {$options.identity.email}.

**If you are connecting to {$options.identity.orgname} via a switch using UTP, please ensure to use a cross over cable on your end.**


Member Portal :: IXP Manager
============================

{$options.identity.orgname} provides a portal for members which provides traffic graphs for your ports, the ability to self-provision some services, the contact and peering details of all other members, a Peering Manager tool, documentation, support information, mailing list subscription management and much more.

Every member is assigned an Administration account with which you then create individual user accounts. The Administration account is only meant for this purpose and as such, all functionality is only available through user accounts.

{if $admins|@count}
We have created your administration account(s) with the following username(s) and email address(es):

{foreach $admins as $a}
  * {$a->getUsername()} <{$a->getEmail()}>
{/foreach}

Please browse to the following page and use the 'Lost Password' facility to set a new password for this account.

{genUrl controller="auth" action="lost-password"}
{else}
Please contact us for your account details at {$options.identity.email}.
{/if}



Route Servers
=============

{$options.identity.orgname} operates a Route Server cluster; this facility allows all members who connect to the cluster to see all routing prefixes sent to the cluster by any other member.  I.e. it provides a quick, safe and easy way to peer with any other route server user.

The {$options.identity.orgname} route server cluster is aimed at:

o  small to medium sized members of the exchange who don't have the time or resources to aggressively manage their peering relationships.

o  larger members of the exchange who have an open peering policy, but where it may not be worth their while managing peering relationships with smaller members of the exchange.

If you don't have any good reasons not to use the route server cluster, you should probably use it.

The service is designed to be reliable. It operates on two physical servers, each located in a different data centre. The service is available on all {$options.identity.orgname} networks (public peering lans #1 and #2, and voip peering lans #1 and #2), on both ipv4 and ipv6.  The route servers also filter inbound routing prefixes based on published RIPE IRR policies, which means that using the route servers for peering is generally much safer than peering directly with other members.

See {genUrl controller="dashboard" action="rs-info"} for more information.

Your Input
----------

If you wish to use the {$options.identity.orgname} route server system, please email {$options.identity.email} or you can enable the sessions yourself via the IXP Manager.


Hosting Routers in the {$options.identity.orgname} Cage
================================

If your company does not have a presence in any of the {$options.identity.orgname}'s co-location facilities, {$options.identity.orgname} can provide rack space for the purpose of housing routers, NTU's and other equipment whose purpose is to facilitate the transmission of IP packets through the exchange.  {$options.identity.orgname} also permits its members to install modems for the purpose of out-of-band access to their equipment.  Each member is assigned 4U of cabinet space by default.  If your company needs more space than this, {$options.identity.orgname} needs to know about it.


Your Input
----------

If you wish to house router equipment in the {$options.identity.orgname} cage, please inform {$options.identity.orgname} operations immediately and provide full details on all the equipment you intend to house in the facility.  We can liaise with you directly to get your equipment installed safely.

If you wish to bring a PSTN phone line into the {$options.identity.orgname} cage to connect a modem to your routing equipment, please let {$options.identity.orgname} Operations know immediately.

-----------


External Connections to the {$options.identity.orgname} Infrastructure
===============================================

Many {$options.identity.orgname} members already have a presence in the co-location facilities which house {$options.identity.orgname} points of presence.  If you are such a member and wish to keep your routing equipment in your own cabinet space, {$options.identity.orgname} is happy to accept cross-connects from your cabinet to the {$options.identity.orgname} cage.  Please note that all connections into the {$options.identity.orgname} cage are paid for directly by {$options.identity.orgname} members, not by {$options.identity.orgname} itself.

{$options.identity.orgname} considers metro ethernet connections as standard external connections. When ordering your metro ethernet circuit, please specify the correct {$options.identity.orgname} termination point to your provider.

Cross-connect cabinet termination points are provided in the "Connection Details" section above.


Your Input
----------

If you want to connect to {$options.identity.orgname} using a cross-connect, you must order it directly from your co-lo / metro ethernet provider and inform {$options.identity.orgname} Operations immediately.  Please ensure that you include full details on the connection type and termination cabinet when ordering the cross-connect from your co-lo provider.

----------


Mailing Lists
=============

To encourage co-operation between {$options.identity.orgname} members, {$options.identity.orgname} provides mailing list services.  There are currently three mailing lists:

----------


INEX Operations
===============

Technical Operations for INEX are provided by Network Ability Ltd (with additional support from Open Source Solutions Ltd). Technical support contact details for INEX can be found at:

        {genUrl controller="static" action="support"}

In general, the best way to contact INEX operations is by email at: operations@inex.ie.  If there is an emergency requiring immediate assistance, please contact one of us on the mobile phones listed on the web page.


Peering
=======

INEX facilitates peering between its members, but other than the minimum current peering requirements (4 members or 10%, whichever is larger) does not mandate peering with any particular member apart from INEX itself.

You will find a full list of members on the IXP Manager, along with the correct email addresses to use for peering requests.

When emailing other INEX members about peering requests, please include all technical details relevant to the peering session, including your IP address, your AS number, and an estimate of the number of prefixes you intend to announce to that candidate peer.  Several members require written legal contracts to be signed as a part of their peering procedures.  If you require a written contract, please specify this on your peering request; similarly, it may be often useful to indicate your willingness (or otherwise) to sign legal contracts when approaching other members about peering.

The My Peering Manager tool in the IXP Manager will compose mails with the above details for you automatically.

Please note that INEX members are required to reply to peering requests within a reasonable time frame.  If your emails to other INEX members about peering go unanswered, please let us know and we will do what we can.

INEX requires that all new members peer and share routes with the INEX route collectors for administrative purposes.  We would be obliged if you could set up your router(s) and make the necessary arrangements for this as soon as possible.

INEX's details are:

remote-as:      AS2128
AS Macro:       AS-INEXIE

{foreach $customer->getVirtualInterfaces() as $connection}
    {foreach $connection->getVlanInterfaces() as $vli}
        {if $vli->getVlan()->getNumber() eq 10}

Peering VLAN #1
    IPv6 address:       2001:7F8:18::F:0:1
    IPv6 session MD5:   {$vli->getIpv6bgpmd5secret()}

    IPv4 address:       185.6.36.126
    IPv4 session MD5:   {$vli->getIpv4bgpmd5secret()}
{elseif $vli->getVlan()->getNumber() eq 12}

Peering VLAN #2
    IPv6 address:       2001:7F8:18:12::9999
    IPv6 session MD5:   {$vli->getIpv6bgpmd5secret()}

    IPv4 address  :     194.88.240.126
    IPv4 session MD5:   {$vli->getIpv4bgpmd5secret()}
        {/if}

    {/foreach}
{/foreach}

No prefixes are announced by the route collector and it will not forward traffic.


NOC Details
===========

For the convenience of its members, INEX maintains a list of NOC and peering contact details for its members.  These details are held on a private INEX database, and are available only from the IXP Manager on the following URL:

        {genUrl controller="customer" action="details"}

This area of the INEX website is password protected and SSL secured. Passwords are only provided to current INEX members.  This information is considered private and will not be passed on to other third parties by INEX.

We would appreciate if you could take the time to ensure that the following details we hold on file are correct:

Your Input
----------

Member name:                    {$customer->getName()}
Primary corporate web page:     {$customer->getCorpwww()}
Peering Email Address:          {$customer->getPeeringemail()}
NOC Phone number:               {$customer->getNocphone()}
NOC Fax number:                 {$customer->getNocfax()}
General NOC email address:      {$customer->getNocemail()}
NOC Hours:                      {$customer->getNochours()}
Dedicated NOC web page:         {$customer->getNocwww()}
AS Number:                      {$customer->getAutsys()}

----------


Router Configuration
====================

If you are new to internet exchanges, we would ask you to note that all members are expected to adhere to the technical requirements of the INEX MoU.  In particular, we would draw your attention to section 2 of these requirements which outline what types of traffic may and may not be forwarded to the INEX peering LAN.

For Cisco IOS based routers, we recommend the following interface configuration commands:

 no ip redirects
 no ip proxy-arp
 no ip directed-broadcast
 no mop enabled
 no cdp enable
 udld port disable

If you intend to use IPv6 with a Cisco IOS based router, please also consider the following interface commands:

 no ipv6 redirects
 ipv6 nd suppress-ra


Connecting Switches to INEX
===========================

Many members choose to connect their INEX port to a layer 2 switch and then forward their peering traffic to a router virtual interface hosted elsewhere on their network.  While connecting layer 2 switches to the INEX peering LAN is not actively discouraged, incorrect configuration can cause serious and unexpected connectivity problems.

The primary concern is to ensure that only traffic from the router subinterface is presented to the INEX port. INEX implements per port mac address counting: if more than 1 mac address is seen on any switch port at any time, that port will automatically be disabled for a cooling off period, and your connectivity to INEX will temporarily be lost.

This policy prevents two potential problems: firstly, it ensures that layer 2 traffic loops are prevented and secondly, it ensures that no other traffic escapes to the INEX peering LAN which shouldn't be seen there.

If you choose to connect your INEX port or ports to a switch, it is critically important to assign one unique vlan for each INEX connection.  If you share an INEX facing VLAN between multiple INEX ports or share a INEX-facing VLAN with any other network, your connection will automatically be shut down due to the security mechanisms implemented by INEX.

Please also note that by default, several switch models send link-local traffic to all ports.  On Cisco switches, this can be disabled using the following interface commands:

interface GigabitEthernetx/x
 spanning-tree bpdufilter enable
 no keepalive
 no cdp enable
 udld port disable

For further details please see the following URL:

        {genUrl controller="static" action="switches"}


Monitoring
==========

By default, INEX actively monitors all ports on its peering LANs using ICMP PING for both connectivity and host latency.  This monitoring causes about 25 PING packets to be sent to each IP address on the peering LAN every 5 minutes.  If you do not wish for your router to be actively monitored, please mail operations@inex.ie and we can disable this facility.


IRC
===

INEX member staff and other INEX member employees may regularly be seen on irc.inex.ie (port 6697, SSL only), channel #inex-ops. 

Although this IRC server is secured with SSL, INEX does not recommend swapping passwords or any other private / confidential information on this facility.


AS112 Service
=============

For the benefit of its members, INEX hosts an AS112 nameserver which answers bogus requests to private IP address space.  This service is available as a regular peering host on both INEX peering LANs.  Its IP addresses are: 185.6.36.6 and 194.88.240.6.  Should you wish to peer directly with the AS112 server, please contact INEX operations, and we can set up a peering session on the unit.  Otherwise, AS112 is also visible on the INEX route server system.

Please see {genUrl controller="dashboard" action="as112"} for more details and further explanation.



PeeringDB
=========

PeeringDB ( http://www.peeringdb.com/ ) facilitates the exchange of information related to peering. Specifically, what networks are peering, where they are peering, and if they are likely to peer with you.

More and more organisations are using PeeringDB to make decisions on where they should open POPs, provision new links, etc.

We would very much appreciate it if you could mark your new INEX peering under the "Public Peering Locations" section of your PeeringDB page. We are listed as 'INEX'. If you do not yet have a PeeringDB account, we would suggest that you register for one on their site.
