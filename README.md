## IXP Manager V3 Released

IXP Manager V3 was officially released on 2012-12-12 and primarily featured
a significant amount of backend changes:

* code refactoring
* migration to Doctrine2
* removal of all non JQuery JS libraries
* better library consistancy and API interfaces
* security audit

IXP Manager V3 is primarily about INEX trying to fashion IXP Manager as a
true open source project rather than something INEX specific. 


## About IXP Manager

IXP Manager is primarily a web application with associated scripts and
utilities which will allow IXPs to manage new customers, provision new
connections / services and monitor traffic usage. It also has a self
contained customer portal allowing IXP members to view their IXP traffic
statistics and a unique tool called My Peering Manager enabling IXP
members to request, manage and track peerings with other members.

IXP Manager is written in PHP using the Zend Framework, the Doctrine2 ORM
and the Smarty templating engine. The project website and source code
can be viewed at https://github.com/inex/IXP-Manager.

INEX is an Internet eXchange Point and Ireland's IP peering hub. It is a 
neutral, industry-owned Association, founded in 1996, that provides IP 
peering facilities for its members. INEX membership is open to all 
organisations that can benefit from peering their IP traffic.
